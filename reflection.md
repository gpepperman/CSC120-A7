- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
My first impression is that inheritance makes programming feel much more streamlined and logical. It’s really helpful to be able to reuse code from a superclass instead of rewriting the same things over and over again. It also makes the relationships between different classes easier to understand and keeps the overall structure of the program cleaner.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
When writing the methods, I worked from top to bottom on the requirements. However, the requirements were not always ordered in the best way. For example, when working with the Library class I built elaborate if/else ladders for the checkout and return methods, which I then had to go back to and simplify once I realized there were methods contains and available. So I would recommend that students look holistically at the methods of each class before coding to see what would be the best order to work in.

-Changes?
I have fixed the exceptions I was missing and fixed some style guidelines errors.
